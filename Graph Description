The first 9 values of the graph which satifies the condition is repeated several times until the counter reached 100, it
repeated due to the second condition which states that if the index is equal or above 10 then the index would be subtracted by 2 
and this repeats until the value satisfies the first condition therefore making the first 9 values repeat which makes the graph oscillate
uniformly where the lowest is -7 and peaking at 74 which could be obtained from the formula of the first condition.
